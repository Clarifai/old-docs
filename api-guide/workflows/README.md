# Creating Workflows

Use Mesh Workflows to process complex logic, gain insights and build targeted solutions. With Mesh Workflows, you can work with your machine learning models like they are nodes in a graph. Clarifai makes it easy to connect together models of different kinds so that you can perform complex operations on your data, and build solutions that target your specific business needs.
