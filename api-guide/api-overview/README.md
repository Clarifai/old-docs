# API overview

Our API enables you to build AI applications with capabilities like prediction, search and custom training.

Access our API over HTTPS via `https://api.clarifai.com`. In the examples throughout our documentation, we use single brackets `{variable}` to indicate variables that you should replace with a real value.

We recommend using a [client library](./api-clients.md) to access the API. We offer official clients in a variety of languages.
To access the Clarifai API in other languages, use the REST API directly. For REST documentation
please see the cURL examples.
