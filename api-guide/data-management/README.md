# Data management

Our platform enables you to store, analyze, search, and slice-and-dice your dataset. We offer a variety of specialized tooling to help you optimize your data for machine learning.

You can upload images from your computer, publicly accessible URLs, or file bytes. If you are sending file bytes, you must use base64 encoding.
