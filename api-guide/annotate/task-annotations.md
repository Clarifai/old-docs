## Task Annotations

In order to keep track of each user's work assigned to a task, all the annotations of this user related to this task should be linked to the task id.

Therefore, when a user creates an annotation, the task id should be provided as below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="cURL" %}
```text
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
    {
      "annotations": [
        {
          "input_id": "{{asset_id}}",
          "data": {
            "concepts": [
              {
                "id": "tree",
                "value": 1
              },
              {
                "id": "water",
                "value": 0
              }
            ]
          },
          "annotation_info": {
            "task_id": "{{task_id}}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }'\
