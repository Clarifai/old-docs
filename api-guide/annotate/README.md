# Annotate

Annotations \(sometimes called "labels"\) are how we "teach" machines to recognize concepts. When you want to create a custom model for your business, you do this by training this model to recognize the concepts that you have annotated on your sample data.

{% hint style="info" %}
Annotations are similar to predictions, in that both are concerned with the concepts that your model can recognize. There is one important distinction to keep in mind:
People make annotations about concepts,
Models make predictions about concepts
{% endhint %}
