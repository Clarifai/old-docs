# Authentication

App-specific API Keys are used to authorize your Clarifai applications. You can go to an [Application's detail page](https://portal.clarifai.com/apps) to create a new key. A key only gives you access to a single app.

You have fine-grained control over the data exposed through your app. You can control the scope of an API Key through a simple checkbox interface when you first set up your app.

{% hint style="info" %}
API Keys do not expire. In case your API Key gets compromised, you should delete that key, and create a new one with the same scopes.
{% endhint %}

## Authorize Applications

Select the application that you want to authorize using this key. An API Key cannot be used across multiple apps.

## Key Description

Use this field to create a descriptive name for your API Key. As you start to create a lot of keys, you would need this field to keep track of what key is for what purpose. Note: this field is not used for any identification purposes.

## Scopes

You will see a list of scopes that you can add on to your API Key for the app that was selected. We recommend generating different keys for very specific purposes - this is the best approach to keep your app secure from malicious attacks. Do **NOT** share your API Key with other users.

You have control over both operation and endpoint level scopes.

### Operation Level Scopes

Operation level scopes provide control over the ability to read, write, or delete a given resource type.

**Annotation**
* Annotations:Add (Write Annotations)
* Annotations:Delete (Delete Annotations)
* Annotations:Get (Read Annotations)

**Concept**
* Concepts:Add (Write Concepts)
* Concepts:Get (Read Concepts)

**Input**
* Inputs:Add (Write Inputs)
* Inputs:Delete (Delete Inputs)
* Inputs:Get (Read Inputs)

**Model**
* Models:Add (Write Models)
* Models:Delete (Delete Models)
* Models:Get (Read Models)
* Models:Train (Train a Custom Model)

**Predict**
* Predict (Predict on Public and Custom Models)

**Search**
* Search (Search by Inputs and Concepts)

**Workflow**
* Workflows:Add (Write Workflows)
* Workflows:Delete (Delete Workflows)
* Workflows:Get (Read Workflows)

### Endpoint level scopes

Endpoint level scopes give you control over access to specific endpoints.

**Concept**

* /clarifai.api.V2/GetConceptCounts
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListConcepts
* /clarifai.api.V2/PatchConcepts
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostConcepts
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostConceptsSearches

**Input**

* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteInput
* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteInputs
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetInput
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetInputCount
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListInputs
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListModelInputs
* /clarifai.api.V2/PatchInputs
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostInputs

**Model**

* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteModel
* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteModelVersion
* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteModels
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetModel
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetModelOutputInfo
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetModelVersion
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetModelVersionMetrics
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListModelVersions
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListModels
* /clarifai.api.V2/PatchModels
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostModelVersionMetrics
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostModelVersions
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostModels
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostModelsSearches

**Search**

* /clarifai.api.V2/PostSearches

**Workflows**

* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteWorkflow
* /clarifai.api.V2/DeleteWorkflows
* /clarifai.api.V2/GetWorkflow
* /clarifai.api.V2/ListWorkflows
* /clarifai.api.V2/PatchWorkflows
* /clarifai.api.V2/PostWorkflows

### Combining Scopes

A variety of use cases can be address by selecting different combinations of scopes.

For example, you might want to create an app that only has access to the search endpoint, but for search to work properly it needs access to Predict at the operation level (so that it can perform advanced visual searches like searching by an image crop, which first needs to be understood with a prediction before search is performed).

By giving the combination of predict op-level but only search endpoint, you can create an app that can perform searches, but not model predictions (like PostModelOutputs).

For more information, learn about our [API conventions](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/api-conventions).

## Authorize API Calls

After creating your `API Key`, you are ready to make API calls. If you are using a client, authentication will be handled for you. If you are using the REST API, you will need to add the `Authorization` header as described in the cURL example.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="js" %}
```js
const app = new Clarifai.App({apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'});
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="python" %}
```python
from clarifai.rest import ClarifaiApp

app = ClarifaiApp(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="java" %}
```java
new ClarifaiBuilder("YOUR_API_KEY").buildSync();
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="csharp" %}
```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Clarifai.API;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    public class YourClassName
    {
        public static async Task Main()
        {
            var client = new ClarifaiClient("YOUR_API_KEY");
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="objective-c" %}
```objective-c
ClarifaiApp *app = [[ClarifaiApp alloc] initWithApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"];

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="php" %}
```php
use Clarifai\API\ClarifaiClient;

$client = new ClarifaiClient('YOUR_API_KEY');
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}

{% code-tabs-item title="cURL" %}
```cURL
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}



If the API Key does not have the required scope\(s\), you will receive one of the following responses: 1. Rejected Request: if a large portion of the response requires a scope that is missing 2. Redacted Response: if majority of the response has the required scope\(s\), a small portion of the response will be redacted to not reveal unwarranted information
