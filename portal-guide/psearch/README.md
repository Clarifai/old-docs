# Search

AI models can be used to power search. Our API automatically indexes your inputs so that they are ready for search from the moment they are uploaded. Once indexed, you can search for images by concept, visual similarity, or metadata.

With our transfer learning technology, your model can learn new concepts in seconds or minutes, and then Clarifai's patented search technology can be used to search for this concept immediately, without the need for reindexing.
