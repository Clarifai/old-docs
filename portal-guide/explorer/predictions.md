# Predictions

![The predictions lets you view annotations and predictions in one place.](../../.gitbook/assets/predictions-tab.jpg)

The prediction tab will show you all annotations for a given input and will provide additional information about who added a given annotation. Any time an annotation has been added by you, the logged-in user, you will see a solid green checkmark, or a solid red "x". 

You can view your model predictions in the righthand most column of the prediction tab.
