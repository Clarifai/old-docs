## Video

Scribe provides powerful tools for labeling video. When working with video, you can leverage video interpolation tools to quickly label thousands of individual frames of video. This rapid labeling technique makes video an excellent source of training data, even if you want your model to primarily analyze still images. You can QuickTrain and DeepTrain models on video data that has been labeled in Scribe.

### Interpolation

Interpolation allows you to quickly label multiple frames of video with the same concept. Simply select the interpolation icon and draw a bounding box around the object that you would like to label. Then scrub the video player to a new point in the video and move and adjust the bounding box to the new location of the object. Interpolation will automatically draw a series of bounding boxes between them.
