## Video

### Interpolation

Interpolation allows you to quickly label multiple frames of video with the same concept. Simply select the interpolation icon and draw a bounding box around the object that you would like to label. Then scrub the video player to a new point in the video and move and adjust the bounding box to the new location of the object. Interpolation will automatically draw a series of bounding boxes between them.
