Our platform enables you to store, analyze, search, and slice-and-dice your dataset. We offer a variety of specialized tooling to help you optimize your data for machine learning. 

You can upload images or videos from your computer, publicly accessible URLs, or file bytes. If you are sending file bytes, you must use base64 encoding.

You are encouraged to send inputs with your own `id`. This will help you later match the input to your own database. If you do not send an `id`, one will be created for you.
