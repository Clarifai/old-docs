The concepts in your model can be used to power search.
The Search API allows you to send images (url or bytes) to the service and have them indexed by model concepts and their visual representations. Once indexed, you can search for images by concept, image, or many advanced search parameters.
Search API lets you combine search criteria 
## Rank 
Order your search results with the intuitive insights of AI. Your model can identify concepts in your data and rank your search results by how confident it is that a given concept is present. You can even rank search results by how similar one input is to another input.
## Filter 
Trim down the amount of data returned in search. For example, you may only want to see inputs that one of your collaborators has labeled with the word “dog”. Or perhaps you want only those inputs that were captured in a certain geographical region.
## 'AND' 
Combine multiple search parameters. For example, you can find all the inputs within a geographical region with a "weapon" in them, or all annotations assigned to user "Joe", or visually similar product images that are assigned the word "XL" in metadata.
