### Filter by metadata

Attach additional information to your inputs as you upload them to the Clarifai platform. Add product IDs, user IDs, or any other relevant information needed to drive specific business outcomes. Metadata is indexed so that the result is filtered down and then ranked according to the ranking criteria you provide.

### Filter by geo-location

Combine visual search with location-awareness to organize your data by place. Include latitude and longitude information when you upload your data, and then filter to find all inputs within a given radius. Or even define a region on the map and limit your results to the inputs within that region.

### Filter by annotations

Annotations are the human-labeled concepts on your inputs. Typically part of your "training" dataset, these inputs are indexed alongside model predictions and similarity search information. Collaboration tools make it easy to track annotations done by different team members.

### Filter by annotation info

Provide additional information about annotation sets. For example, you might label a “training split”, a “golden set”, or “data export 73”. Export your data and use annotations for any complex application logic you can dream of. Include contextual information in the form of generic JSON blobs.
