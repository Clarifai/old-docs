# Role-Based Access Control

Role-based access control \(RBAC\) functionality enables application admins to limit the permissions of some users within a team. It is both a security best practice \(see the principle of least privilege\) and often a compliance requirement for admins to maintain separate accounts for their user level activities.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently RBAC is available to our on-premise enterprise customers only. RBAC is coming to cloud customers soon, stay tuned.

## User Management

### Create New Users

The administrator can create a new user under the user management section. This is a straightforward way for the administrator to provision new users to the system. First Name, Last Name, Email and the Password will be needed to create a new user into the system.
