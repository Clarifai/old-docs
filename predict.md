The Predict API analyzes your images or videos and tells you what's inside of them. The API will return a list of concepts with corresponding probabilities of how likely it is these concepts are contained within the image or video.

We recommend specifying the `version id` parameter in your predict calls. If no `version id` is specified, predictions will occur on the most recent version of the model.
