# App-Specific API Keys

App-specific API Keys are used to authorize your Clarifai applications. A key is automatically generated when you create a new application. You can also go to the [Application's List](https://portal.clarifai.com/apps), select an app of your choice and create a new key in the app details page. _Each API key is tied to a specific user and a specific app._

You have fine-grained control over the data exposed through your app. You can control the scope of an API Key through a simple checkbox interface when you first set up your app.

{% hint style="info" %}
API Keys do not expire. In case your API Key gets compromised, you should delete that key, and create a new one with the same scopes. We recommend that you do **not** share your API Key with other users.
