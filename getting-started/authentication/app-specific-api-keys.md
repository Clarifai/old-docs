# App-Specific API Keys

App-specific API Keys are used to authorize your Clarifai applications. You can go to an [Application's detail page](https://portal.clarifai.com/apps) to create a new key. A key only gives you access to a single app. Do **NOT** share your API Key with other users.

You have fine-grained control over the data exposed through your app. You can control the scope of an API Key through a simple checkbox interface when you first set up your app.

{% hint style="info" %}
API Keys do not expire. In case your API Key gets compromised, you should delete that key, and create a new one with the same scopes.
