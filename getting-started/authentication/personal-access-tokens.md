# Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens (PAT here for short) represent a specific user when accessing the Clarifai API.

PATs allow you to access multiple apps with a single API key. PATs allow a user to access their own apps and any apps where they have been added as collaborators.

PATs also allow you to create apps and app-specific API keys programmatically through the API. This is crucial for programs that segregate data of each of their end-users into different apps.

To create a new PAT, navigate to the bottom left hand corner of the application overview page and click on your initials:
