# Authentication

Our platform makes it easy for organizations to keep their data secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access protected resources. You control access to your applications with API keys and personal access tokens.

A good understanding of how we designed the API and the conventions will help in understanding our operation-level and endpoint-level scopes. For more information, learn about our [API conventions](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/clarifai-api-conventions).
