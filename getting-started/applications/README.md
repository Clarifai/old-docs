# Applications

Your data, annotations, models, predictions and searches are contained within applications. You can create as many applications as you want and can edit or delete them as you see fit. You can think of applications as projects. They are a collection of resources and provide control over the permissions to those resources.

Each application is authenticated with a unique API Key. You can learn more about authentication on the next page.
