# Applications

You can think of applications as AI projects. Your data, annotations, models, predictions and searches are contained within applications. You can create as many applications as you want and can edit or delete them as you see fit.

Applications include a variety of resources and provide control over access to those resources. Access to each application can be controlled using one, or more App-Specific API Keys. You can learn more about [authentication](https://docs.clarifai.com/getting-started/authentication) in the next section.
