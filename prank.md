### Search by similarity 

Go beyond simple keyword searches. Draw a direct line from the source of an idea (an image, video, or block of text), to the information you need. No guessing keywords required. Similarly Search can be combined with detection models so that you can search for a specific thing a region of an image. You can even use an image to find a specific frame within a video clip.
