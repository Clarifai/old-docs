To create an application, head on over to the [applications page](https://portal.clarifai.com/apps) and press the 'Create a New Application' button. Here, you will name your application and choose a [model](https://www.clarifai.com/models) for your base workflow.

You can also set the default language. If you plan on using a language other than English, you must choose the General model under Base Workflow.
