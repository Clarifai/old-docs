Clarifai offers AI as a service. Whether you have one input or billions, you are only steps away from using artificial intelligence for your business applications.

The type of prediction we return depends the model you use. For example, if you send your input through our 'Food' model, we return concepts that the 'Food' model knows about - things like hamburgers and french fries.
